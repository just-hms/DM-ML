# DM-ML

please prepare a short presentation (3 slides) aimed at describing your project proposal, to be discussed in one of the upcoming lectures.
The presentation should cover the following aspects:
- what is the problem you want to solve (context)
- what data you have / how you plan to gather it / â€¦ (dataset)
- how you formulate your problem and how you plan to deal with it. Specify clearly what you expect to have as input and as output (system)

Please notify us via email (alessandro.renda@unipi.it, francesco.marcelloni@unipi.it) when you are ready to discuss the proposal. As soon as possible we will allocate a slot during the upcoming lectures for the group discussion.
